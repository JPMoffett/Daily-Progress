# Day 03 – December 03, 2025

## 1. Goals for Today
- Goal 1 Continue a daily cybersecurity study routine
- Goal 2 Add a chapter to my ultra-mega top-secret book on tech
- Goal 3 Complete daily lessons, and reading a chapter from
	Linux Basics For Hackers
	The 48 Laws of Power
	Meditations by Marcus Aurelius

## 2. Lessons Learned
 - Bash: Viewing files (cat, less, head, tail)
 - Python: Numeric types and arithmetic
 - SQL: SELECT basics
 - Pentesting: Active recon intro (ping sweeps)

## 3. Exercises / Projects Completed
- Performed OSINT on two fictitious companies
- Ran fping and nmat on some networks

## 4. Challenges / Roadblocks
- Somehow while setting up my VirtualBox labnet I made it so Kali could no longer access the internet, so I fixed it - not by discovering the error and correcting it but by installing a new Kali vm.
This is not evasion. It’s avoision. 

## 5. Reflections / Insights
- Went back to my old chair and it’s suddenly much more comfortable – the implication here being that it’s discomforting architecture is deliberate, and only after realizing the doom of abandonment did it decide to be a team player.
- I’ve realized that Red Teaming is more than a career. Philosophical Manifesto coming soon.
- Discovered that listening to Paul McCartney’s ‘If I Ever Get Out of Here’ on repeat for six hours makes me feel “some kinda way”.
