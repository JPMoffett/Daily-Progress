## 1. Goals for Today
- Goal 1 Continue a daily cybersecurity study routine
- Goal 2 Add a chapter to my ultra-mega top-secret book on tech

	Linux Basics For Hackers

## 2. Lessons Learned
Bash: Shell scripting intro (#/bin/bash, running scripts)
Python: Python modules & imports

## 3. Projects/Goals
 - I had something really important to announce but I've forgotten what it was. 
 - I started a spreadsheet where I will keep track of the occupancy of the kitchen and bathroom 
in the house where I live in order to find the bottle-neck/times-to-avoid going inside, so I can
later on write a py script to predict the optimal times for eating and uneating.
