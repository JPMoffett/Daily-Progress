# Day 04 – December 04, 2025

## 1. Goals for Today
- Goal 1 Continue a daily cybersecurity study routine
- Goal 2 Add a chapter to my ultra-mega top-secret book on tech (now 1/4 finished)
- Goal 3 Complete daily lessons, and reading a chapter from
	Linux Basics For Hackers
	The 48 Laws of Power
	Meditations by Marcus Aurelius

## 2. Lessons Learned
 - Bash: cp, mv, rm file manipulation
 - Python: Boolean logic and comparisons
 - SQL: WHERE filtering
 - Pentesting: Nmap basics (TCP connect scans)

## 3. Exercises / Projects Completed
- In keeping with yesterday’s promise of a philosophical manifesto, I made another simple webpage:
   https://jpmoffett.github.io/Aletheian-Discipline/
-  Performed more nmap scans using TCP Connect scan. 

## 4. Challenges / Roadblocks
- Personal posterior of protective plumpness kept going numb because of chair.
- Very sleepy all day, regardless of caffeine intake (completed all tasks and started vanity project in spite of lackadaisical lethargy). 

## 5. Reflections / Insights
- I really (and I do mean really) enjoy making stupidly simple lil static webpages. They’re the Duplo
  blocks of web development, and I am a simple man.
