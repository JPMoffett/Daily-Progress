## 4. Challenges / Roadblocks
- Today’s greatest challenge has been an unearthly (and unsatisfied) craving for Salisbury Steak.
Now you may say, “Jim Jimminy Jim Jim, you haven’t had that since gradeschool”, but you’d be wrong, friend. 
I had it two nights ago – but it should be tonight. It should be now. CERN threw off the timeline. *shakes fist towards Geneva*

## 5. Reflections / Insights
- While reflecting back upon today’s lessons, I am disturbed and intrigued to discover that I had the song, ‘How Soon Is Now’ by Love Spit Love 
in my head the entire day. Remember? That song from Charmed? All day my bacon had that on repeat. No regerts
